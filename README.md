# FruitsClassification
Uses a subset of fruits-360 dataset from Kaggle 

See the paths.csv for the list of file paths used - note that some of the file path names in the test-multi_fruit folder were changed but only from plural to singular (ie. Strawberries -> Strawberry) but the numbers and underscores remain the same.
